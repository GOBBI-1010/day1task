    <h2>Who are we? How historical is
our Kurumban community (Palangudi Makkal Kurumban) 
? How special were our ancestors?
Thus, without knowing the answer to many questions</h2>
<h3>we have lost the address of our society, our value, respect and honor have been hidden, and we are living without knowing ourselves. If this situation continues, the time will not be far when our posterity and our clan pride, our long historical community of Palangudi Makkal Kurumbar  will be unrecognizable, ostracized and disintegrated.</h3><br><br>
<div class="container">
 <p class="para1">1."kuru" means the guide of knowledge or light of knowledge, "pa" means the world, thus Gurupa means those who give the light of knowledge to the world, those who practice royal tricks, those who hold ministerial posts.
It is not surprising that we are broken with our minds knowing that our society has been wrongly fabricated that we have only been doing the work of herding goats and cows (commodities) and are not suitable for any other profession. 
To realize the truth, let's look back a bit in history. Palangudi Makkal Kurumans  community is an ancient, heroic, spiritual and proud race.
From the time of Mahabharata till today, if we are following clan pride without any clear basis in all fields like culture, tradition, art, literature, love, family structure, we can feel that our valor and culture are mixed even in our blood.

<p class="para3">3.Warrior of Kurumans :Located on the southern bank of the lake, the ancient name of this place is Amaiyur alias Amur. In vernacular it was called Kurmapuri.  An ancient warrior clan called Krumbar lived in this town . The fort they built at Ampur was so strong that their enemies were afraid to approach. Today only small remnants of the fort can be seen. The tombstone of a Krumbar warrior is found. He is called ``Anmayur'' and is said to be Ampur because he reached the hero's heaven because he was able to bear them without tiring and hit some of his enemies even when arrows were thrown at him and pierced his chest.
